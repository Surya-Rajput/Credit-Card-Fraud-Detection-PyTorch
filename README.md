# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-PyTorch

This repository contains a project focused on implementing a credit card fraud detection classifier using a neural network in the PyTorch framework. The goal of the project is to build and evaluate a classifier to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Task

The project tasks are outlined as follows:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing
- Perform EDA on the dataset.
- Conduct data preprocessing, especially addressing data imbalance in the dataset.

### 2. Neural Network Implementation with PyTorch
- Implement a neural network classifier using the PyTorch framework.
- Plot training loss and validation loss.
- Plot training accuracy and validation accuracy.

### 3. Observations and Conclusion
- Provide observations and reasoning throughout the analysis.
- Include a conclusion section at the end of the notebook.
